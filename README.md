# Cookiecutter Scala

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is a command-line utility that creates projects from project templates.

This template is a simple scala hello world application with a few libraries:
- [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt) to build the project
- [ScalaCheck](https://www.scalacheck.org/index.html) to test the code
- [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) to format the code
- [sbt-tpolecat](https://github.com/DavidGregory084/sbt-tpolecat) to avoid some pitfalls
